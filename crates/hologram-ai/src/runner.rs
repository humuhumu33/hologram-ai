//! Inference runner — a thin wrapper over hologram's `InferenceSession`.
//!
//! In the UOR-native model a `.holo` archive is loaded once into an
//! `InferenceSession`, which owns the content-addressed buffer pool and elides
//! repeated computation by κ-label (architecture §5.3, §7). There is no tape
//! builder, no KV-cache, and no runtime shape projection: the compiled archive
//! already carries concrete shapes and a schedule. Autoregressive reuse across
//! decode steps is structural (content-addressed elision), so each step simply
//! re-executes the graph with the next input.
